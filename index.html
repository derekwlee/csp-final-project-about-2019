   <h2>What Is This Website?</h2>
   <p>Here at IHatePollen, we strive to create unity between those who suffer from allergies and those who don't. It's our sole purpose to inform others about our struggles with seasonal allergies,
     as well as providing a system of support for those who do. From red noses to constant sneezing (and the occasional complaining), we feel as though it's a true investment to help someone out in difficult
     allergy seasons. To do this, we have created a community of IHatePollen'ers that help write poems, stories, and news articles for us.
  <h2>Who Are You?</h2>
  <p>My name is Derek Lee and I don't know what I don't know what I'm doing with my life :( I am a fellow seasonal allergy AND oral allergy syndrome sufferer. This is for a Computer Science Principles project and I'm being <i>way</i> to extra with this....
    Anyways Mr. Chan please don't be harsh when grading this project
